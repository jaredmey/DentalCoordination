Through an easy-to-use graphical interface, customers can use the application to log in and add/edit appointments. Employees can log in and view/edit their schedules.

Motivation
------------

- This began as a group project between three colleagues to simplify the process for local dental offices to be able to integrate an online application for scheduling purposes. It grew into a full database-supported application with a homepage template. 

Installation
-------------
-	The application can be downloaded, but the server will not be properly set up to collaborate with the appointment calendar. This must be done separately by the user.
-	To download the application, click on the ZIP file download on this page. 
-	For assistance on navigating the application, refer to the user manual.
